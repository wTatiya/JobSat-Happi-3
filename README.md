# JobSat-Happi-3

This project uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as its web framework. The dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Getting started

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```
2. Verify that Django is available:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m django --version
   ```

These commands install Django into Poetry's virtual environment and confirm the installation.
